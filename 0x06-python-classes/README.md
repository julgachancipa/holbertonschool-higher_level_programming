Holberton teaches full-stack software engineering with a project-based approach.
The first part of our on-site intensive education covers the foundations of software
engineering, including low-level programming, DevOps, and high-level modern languages.

This project is part of *high-level programming*, where you will create a complete web service with databases, back-end, and an amazing front-end
website with the latest technologies. This project will give you all the skills to work in the best
companies in Silicon Valley such as Facebook or Dropbox. You will gain the skills to quickly
learn and adapt to new frameworks for building products or to iterate on an existing
codebase.
