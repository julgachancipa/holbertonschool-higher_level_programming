# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Learning Objectives

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

Holberton teaches full-stack software engineering with a project-based approach.
The first part of our on-site intensive education covers the foundations of software
engineering, including low-level programming, DevOps, and high-level modern languages.

This project is part of *high-level programming*, where you will create a complete web service with databases, back-end, and an amazing front-end
website with the latest technologies. This project will give you all the skills to work in the best
companies in Silicon Valley such as Facebook or Dropbox. You will gain the skills to quickly
learn and adapt to new frameworks for building products or to iterate on an existing
codebase.
